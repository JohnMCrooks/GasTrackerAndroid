#Gas Tracker

Started as a tutorial on the basics of SQLite but has somehow blown past that and is currently evolving into what might someday be a semi-useful app. Currently uses SQLite and MPAndroid.

**Current Features:**
1. Add a new Tank. 
2. Cost over time chart.
3. ???
4. Profit.

**Currently Working On**:
Redoing the Database/SQL to allow for further expansion on the overall idea.


**Features to be added Eventually as I learn more about Android Development:**

-Import/Export Data to Dropbox/Google Drive 
-Mileage tracking and associated statistics 
-More data Visualizations 
-Gps Logging (Long-term goal, but hey, shoot for the stars right?)
