#Gas Tracker

Started as a tutorial on the basics of SQLite but has somehow blown past that and is currently evolving into what might someday be a semi-useful app. Currently uses SQLite and MPAndroid.


Features to be added Eventually as I learn more about Android Development:

-Import/Export Data to Dropbox/Google Drive
-Mileage tracking and associated statistics
-More data Visualizations
-Gps Logging (Long-term goal, but hey, shoot for the stars right?)
